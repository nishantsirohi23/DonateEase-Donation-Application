#### Purpose
- To build a Custom Authentication Experience for Your Application
- Authentication is a crucial part in developing any application. Whether you are developing an internal IT app for your employees, building a portal for your partners, or exposing a set of APIs for developers building apps around your resources, Okta provides the right authentication support for your projects.

- The sign-in experience is one of the most important user experiences any app developer needs to consider. To provide a seamless and attractive, yet secure authentication experience is not a trivial task. Typically, the sign-in logic accompanies other features such as password reset and registration. More importantly, enhanced security in the form of strong and adaptive authentication during the sign-in process is often critical to many implementations.
